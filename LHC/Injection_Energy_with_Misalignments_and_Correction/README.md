Script for creating a thin LHC beam 1 model with misalignments and nonlinear errors.
Misalignments are applied and orbit is corrected.
Nonlinear errors are applied and corrections applied as were used in RunII.
A1/A2/B1/B2 are excluded as these are assumed to have been well corrected and residual betabeating and
coupling stems for misalignments and feed down.
