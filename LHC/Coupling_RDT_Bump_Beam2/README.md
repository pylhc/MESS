Script to create closed coupling RDT bump in Arc12.
This script sets up a Beam2 model (clockwise orientation of the sequence), prints a twiss, and then continues to setup Beam4 (counterclockwise orientation like the real LHC Beam 2) for PTC tracking.
Lattice is loaded and extra skew quadrupoles elements are installed around arc12 to be individually powered later.
Layout as of 2018 and with 2018 proton injection optics (`/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018`).
