Simple LHC tracking script using a 2D Gaussian distribution.
Tracking is done for LHC Beam 1, layout as of 2018 and with 2018 proton injection optics (/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018).

Lattice is loaded and thin lens version is created to be used with PTC tracking.
9999 particles are initalized for a specified emittance and tracked. 
Tracks are saved in a trackone file.
