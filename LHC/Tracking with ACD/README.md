Simple LHC tracking script with AC-Dipole Excitation.
Tracking is done for LHC Beam 1, layout as of 2018 and with 2018 proton injection optics (/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018).

Lattice is loaded and thin lens version is created to be used with MAD-X tracking.
AC-Dipole elements are installed on top of the MKA Kickers, and ramp up and flat top are set as is the case in the LHC.
