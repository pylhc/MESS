Simple script to simulate K-Modulation in Q1 in the LHC.
LHC Beam 1 is used, layout as of 2018 and with 2018 proton collision optics (`/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018`).

K strength of the quadruple is logged in a table together with the tunes and can be used as input for K-Modulation analysis in omc3.
