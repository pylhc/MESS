Simple FODO lattice set-up for benchmarking theories or other other stuff.
Uses thin quadruples and FODO cell are matched to 0.25 in both planes.
Instead of quadrupole for tune matching a matrix element (phase trombone) is used.
Adapted from [this](https://github.com/SixTrack/SixTrack/blob/master/test/orbit6d-element-trombone/createTrombone.madx) Sixtrack test case.
